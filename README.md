A self-project to practice and have a deeper understanding of cleaning excel data source and analysis data.

**Result from analysis**

==========Approve loan========= <br />
Top jobs to qualify for a loan, regardless of emp_length:
1)				Teacher
2) 				Manager
3)				Owner
4)				Driver
5)				Register Nurse
6) 				RN

Interestingly, after check mean emp_length, it does not seem to have heavy impact on ranking as:
_ Highest mean emp_length belongs to rank B,D and E for top 6 jobs

Instead, annual_inc is what seems to affect ranking the most:
_ Except for rank D and E with some of the times peak, most jobs annual income will affect their ranking from A to F in descending order
_ For jobs with average salary below 70k likes Teacher, there seems to have no peak at D and E likes high income jobs like Owner or Register Nurse

Average reject loan amount: 12,515.383107916085 <br />
Average reject employment length: 0.11361334536236832 years <br />
